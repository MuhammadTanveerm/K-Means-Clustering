𝐊-𝐌𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐬 𝐂𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠
     K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group data points into K distinct clusters based on similarity. 
𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐆𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐠 
       It automatically groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters based on similarity
𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭  𝐢𝐬 𝐂𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠
      This task of grouping data points based on their similarity
It is called clustering or cluster analysis.
This method is defined under the branch of unsupervised learning, whose aim is to get insight from unlabeled data points. Unlike supervised learning, we don't have a target variable.

      Each cluster is represented by a centroid, which is the average of all data points within that cluster.

  𝐈𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐞: K-means starts by randomly selecting K initial centroids, which represent the centers of the clusters. 
  𝐀𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧: Assign each item to the nearest based on Euclidean distance.
  𝐔𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞:  Recalculate centroids by averaging the points in each cluster 
  𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐞𝐚𝐭: Reassign and update until convergence (centroid stabilizes)
𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜:
   𝐄𝐮𝐜𝐥𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐚𝐧 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞: Measuring straight line distance between 
points in space.
   𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐚𝐧 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞: Sum of absolute difference b/w points useful for grid-like structures.
   𝐂𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐒𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲: Measures angle between vectors, ideal for high-dimensional data.
    𝐌𝐢𝐧𝐤𝐨𝐰𝐬𝐤𝐢: Generalization of  Euclidean and Manhattan distance offering flexible distance calculation.

    𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐬𝐞𝐠𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Identifying different customer groups with similar purchasing behaviors.
𝐈𝐦𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐬𝐞𝐠𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Grouping pixels with similar characteristics.
𝐀𝐧𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐲 𝐝𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Identifying data points that don't belong to any cluster.
𝐃𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠: Grouping similar documents together.
